This project is a Python-based data visualization tool that analyzes and presents historical data on U.S. legislative activity, inflation rates, and notable events.
Data Sources

   * **unemployment_rates_historic.xlsx:** This file contains historical unemployment rates.
   * **law_names_final_1953-2022.xlsx:** This file contains a list of laws passed between 1953 and 2022, including their descriptions.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required for this project:

   * pandas
   * numpy
   * plotly

## Getting Started

   1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
   2. Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed.
   3. Run the Python script to generate the visualizations.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single Python script that reads in data from Excel files and processes it for visualization.

The main components of the script are as follows:

    1. Read and process the data from the Excel files.
    2. Clean and preprocess the data for visualization.
    3. Create and display interactive Plotly graphs, such as scatter plots and line plots.

The visualizations generated by the script include the total number of laws passed per year with and without descriptions, as well as inflation rates and notable events for each year.
## Usage

Run the Python script to generate the visualizations. The script will display the interactive Plotly graphs in your default web browser.

``` python script_name.py ```

Replace **script_name.py** with the name of the Python script file.
